# ROTTR Mod Manager
Mod manager for Rise of the Tomb Raider.

Features:
* Version-independent. Mods that originally only worked on older versions of the game can now be installed in the newest one.
* Fast - can quickly install so-called "deep search" mods (where all references to a certain resource are replaced) regardless of which other mods are already installed.
* Creates new game archives rather than modifying existing ones.
* Can install mods from a folder or straight from a .zip, .7z, or .rar archive, either using the toolbar buttons or by drag&drop onto the window or .exe.
* Individual mods can be removed or even temporarily disabled, without having to start from scratch and reinstalling all the other mods.
* Automatically reinstalls mods when a change in the original game files is detected (e.g. because a DLC was installed).
